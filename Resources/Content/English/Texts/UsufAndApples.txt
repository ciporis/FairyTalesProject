There was a Kitten. He loved Allah very much and, although he was little, already knew all the important words. And which ones you will know soon. $Today, as soon as the first golden rays of sunshine appeared in the window, Kitty woke up, pulled out black paws with pink pads and grunted:- Moore-r-r-r, Alhamdullih! $It was the first important word, and it means: «Praise Allah». So Kitok thanked the Almighty for a new day. Then the cat cleaned his sharp teeth, washed himself and, having put back a hairy tail, ran to the kitchen. $Parents have gone away, but caring mother Cat left for the beloved son on the table a delicious breakfast: porridge with fish tails. $- Moore-r-r, delicious! - said Kitty enough, added: - Bismillows! - and began with appetite to swarm breakfast. $«Bismilyyah» is another important expression, it means: «With the name of Allah»; and these words should begin any of the business. $When the bowl was clean, the baby wiped off a mustache and said:- Alhamdullish! 
You remember what those words mean? $Right! «Praise Allah». $Then the cat ran outside. Today he decided to run to his friend Puppy, play football with him at Chameleque Pole.$- In Allah, Puppy will be home and we’ll play! - said Kitty.$The words «in sha Allah» are also very important! They mean: «If Allah wills». $And here comes the Kitten on the path, so fast that the wind whistles in his ears! And suddenly a monster blocked his way. Scary! Green, hairy! The cat barely stopped, he bounced back, swelled with a furry ball, and how it would go off:$- W-W-H! Free-F-I-F! Here’s the tickets! These words mean: «I have recourse to the protection of Allah». They are said when they need the protection of the Most High and his help. $As soon as the cat said: «Wow, you are lucky», - fear passed. The baby dared, looked at the monster and realized that it is just a caterpillar! $Small and harmless. He laughed at himself and ran away. $
 He soon reached the Puppy’s cabin and saw a friend.
- Assalam aleikum! - said a happy hello to the kitten.$The words «in sha Allah» are also very important! They mean: «If Allah wishes». $And here comes the Kitten on the path, so fast that the wind whistles in his ears! And suddenly a monster blocked his way. Scary! Green, hairy! The cat barely stopped, he bounced back, swelled with a furry ball, and how it would go off:$- W-W-H! Free-F-I-F! Here’s the tickets! These words mean: «I have recourse to the protection of Allah». They are said when they need the protection of the Most High and his help. $As soon as the cat said: «Wow, you are lucky», - fear passed. The baby dared, looked at the monster and realized that it is just a caterpillar! $Small and harmless. He laughed at himself and ran away. $
 He soon reached the Puppy’s cabin and saw a friend.
– Assalam aleikum! - said a happy hello to the little one.$ These are greeting words, they mean: «Peace for you». Red Puppy happily silenced the bun-tail and answered loudly:
 – Wa aleikum Asali! said, and suddenly as if sneezing:$- A-a-apchi! Alhamdulliyah! $Little Cat knew that Muslims always say after sneezing: «Alhamdullilah», - so he smiled and wished:
 – Yarhamukullah! $This is what they always say to the one who sneezes and says «Alhamdullikh», and these words mean: «May Allah have mercy on you». $Friends took the ball and ran to play. Ran, jumped, until they were tired. It was time for lunch. $Kitten was very hungry. He said goodbye to his friend and rushed home, where a surprise was waiting for him. Mom made his favorite sausages! $The cat cheered and shouted:
 – My favorite sausages! Ma sha Allah! $The words «Ma sha Allah» mean: «This is what Allah wanted». That’s what they say when they’re happy with something or admire someone. $After a delicious meal, Kitty decided to lie down. But lying there was boring, and the baby wanted to read. $Only his favorite book lay on the bookshelf. And the regiment was as high as Mount Kilimanjaro! But Kitten did not stop. $He first jumped on a chair, then on the table, then on the chest of drawers, from which he jumped with all his cat’s strength. But he did not...$He could only grab the edge of the shelf with his feet. Realized that the cat would fall now, and began to call for help:
 – Ma-a-a! Ma-a-a-a! Ma-a-u! Luckily, Mama Cat heard the scream and came to her aid. $Helped the boy down, felt sorry for him, then fought, then one more time. $The cat’s spirit passed over and thanked the Lord of Worlds for saving him. $And then thought a little and asked forgiveness from the Almighty for being so careless and scared Mommy. $Cat whispered:
- Astagfirullah!
These words are translated as: «I beg Allah’s forgiveness!» At night, when the sun gave way to the yellow moon, Kitty ran out into the yard and climbed up the tree. $He often came here and enjoyed the beauty of Allah’s creations. The little boy climbed on a beautiful moon and said:- Subhan Allah! $«Subhan Allah» means: «Prullaven Allah»; these words are used when they see something amazing and extraordinarily beautiful. $And then Kitty heard Papa Cat loudly reciting the azan - a call to night prayer-namaz. $In the azan were also very important words: «Allah Akbar» and «La Gilah Illullah». 
«Allah Akbar» means: «Allah is above all». $That’s how Muslims say when they want to exalt the Almighty.$ «La ilyaha illullah» - the most important words for all Muslims. $They mean that only Allah - and no one else - is worthy of our worship, our requests and prayers. $Kitty came home, read the night napalm with dad and mom. Together they asked Allah for strength, health, and that tomorrow be as interesting and joyful. $And then it was time to sleep, Kitten licked the noses of Mom and Dad, curled up in his soft crib and whispered: Bismicellahumma amu wa ahiah! This is the dua that Muslims read before going to sleep, it means: «By your name, Allah, I die and I live again». $After these words Kitten smiled and fell asleep.
